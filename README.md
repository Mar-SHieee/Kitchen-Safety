# Smart Kitchen Safety

**Smart Kitchen Safety** is an IoT-based solution designed to enhance kitchen safety by monitoring environmental conditions in real-time and mitigating risks through actuators. Developed during IoT training at the Faculty of Computing and Data Science, Alexandria University, by team members, it integrates a Flutter mobile app with an ESP32 microcontroller, leveraging **Supabase**, **MQTT**, and local notifications.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: User signup/login with email, password, and username via Supabase (`auth_service.dart`, `auth_screen.dart`).  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays live sensor readings (gas, flame, temperature, humidity) with status updates (`Safe`, `Warning`, `Danger`) on the app (`live_status_screen.dart`, `view_sensors_page.dart`) and ESP32 LCD (`KitchenSafetyESP.ino`).  
- **Sensor Management**: Add/delete up to 4 sensors (`add_sensor_page.dart`, `delete_sensor_page.dart`).  
- **Customizable Alerts**: Enable notifications (with/without vibration) and control actuators (LED, buzzer, servo) via MQTT (`alerts_page.dart`).  
- **Local Notifications**: Triggers alerts with vibration and sound for danger conditions (`notification_service.dart`).  
- **Historical Logs**: View sensor data history with timestamps and statuses (`sensor_logs_screen.dart`).  
- **Responsive UI**: Modern design with animations (pulse, fade, slide) and consistent themes (`app_theme.dart`, `app_models.dart`).  
- **ESP32 Integration**: Collects sensor data, controls actuators, and displays status on a 16x2 LCD (`KitchenSafetyESP.ino`).

## Contribution to SDGs

- **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being**: Prevents health hazards like gas poisoning, burns, or respiratory issues.  
- **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**: Enhances home safety for safer urban environments.  
- **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**: Advances smart home technology via IoT integration.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend (Flutter)**: StatefulWidgets for dynamic UI; Provider/setState for state management.  
- **Backend (Supabase)**: Authentication, data storage, real-time subscriptions (`supabase_service.dart`).  
- **MQTT**: Real-time IoT communication via Singleton pattern (`mqtt_service.dart`) and ESP32 (`KitchenSafetyESP.ino`).  
- **Local Notifications**: Multiple channels (danger, warning, info) with vibration and sound (`notification_service.dart`).  
- **Embedded System (ESP32)**: Collects sensor data, controls LED, buzzer, and servo, displays on LCD, communicates with Supabase/MQTT.  
- **Data Models**: Defined in `app_models.dart` (e.g., SensorType, SensorStatus, SystemStatus, Sensor, SensorLog, AlertSettings).

Set up tables: profiles, user_sensors, sensors, user_alerts.
Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for secure data access.


Configure MQTT:
Set up an MQTT broker (e.g., HiveMQ Cloud) and update mqtt_service.dart with broker URL, port, username, and password.
Secure credentials using a .env file with flutter_dotenv.


Configure Notifications:
Add @mipmap/ic_launcher1 to Android resources.
Add a custom sound (alert) to android/app/src/main/res/raw for danger notifications.


Run the App:flutter run



ESP32 Firmware

Install Arduino IDE and add ESP32 board support.
Install Libraries:
DHT sensor library, LiquidCrystal_I2C, ESP32Servo, PubSubClient, WiFiClientSecure, HTTPClient.
